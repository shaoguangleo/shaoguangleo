# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a father of twin boys and also an radio astronomer working at the Shanghai Astronomy Observatory(SHAO). 
In my time as an astronomer I explored the VLBI technique and SKA project, and developed software workflows to support radio astronomy data recording, transferring, processing and simulationing. 
At the SHAO I currently involve the research and development in SKA era, support astronomers via the ChinaSRC-P, maintain the ChinaSRC-P, and support variety of data science projects within SHAO.
