# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a proud father of twin boys :boy::boy: and also a radio astronomer :telescope: deeply engaged in unraveling the mysteries of the universe working at the Shanghai Astronomy Observatory(SHAO). 

My journey in astronomy has led me to explore the intricacies of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) techniques which was used in CELP and the groundbreaking Square Kilometre Array (SKA) project. 

Leading the Research and Development (R&D) efforts for the SKA Regional Center at SHAO, I'm at the forefront of developing innovative solutions for the era of big data astronomy. 
This involves creating and implementing software workflows to efficiently handle the massive data streams (PB scale) from radio telescopes, encompassing recording(32Gbps), transferring, processing, and simulation :clock8:. 

At SHAO, my current work focused on cutting-edge research in radio data processsing(baseband/correlation/imaging), as well as algorithm and software development - an initiative I refer to as "X-lab". Through this endeavor, I aim to provide comprehensive support, from the underlying infrastructure to application layers, from our future synthesis array and radio telescopes.

Additionally, I actively support and maintain a diverse range of data science projects.

In my downtime :coffee: , I find joy and intellectual stimulation in reading and writing.
